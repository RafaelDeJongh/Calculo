With design types we could have a lot more options but we simplified it to two, making it more understandable for everyone. Here we have:

#### Template

Choosing a template allows faster developments and is more affordable. By choosing an existing template, your developer will focus on adjusting it to your needs, making the process easier for both parties.

WordPress has currently over 2000 Free quality themes, and services like ThemeForest.Net can provide even more Premium themes to choose from. It really is one of the better choices to vastly lower the development cost of the actual website.

#### Custom Design

A Custom Design on the other hand is made completely from scratch. Both a design team and UI/UX expert will work on the theme to create that perfect and unique fit for you. This will increase the development cost quite a bit, but it set your website apart and allow it to better match your brand.
