Build speed is definitely also a component that you have to take into account, the faster you want the website to be build, the more money it will cost as it has to take priority into account.

Most websites are usually finished between one or two months, this depends of course on the requirements and features that the website needs.

Providing more time for the development of the website in turns will decrease the price as you are providing the developers with more breathing room to create your website.

This is in reverse if you want your website to be done very fast and then weâ€™re speaking less than a month, this heavily increases the price as then full priority is given to the project and sometimes even requires additional developers to get the website with its features done in the provided time period.
