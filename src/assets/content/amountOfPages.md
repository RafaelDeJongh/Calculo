A big part of the creation of the website is the pages. Depending on the number of pages the total amount can also drastically change.

A default number of pages for a website is pretty much between 1 to 10 pages, and this is also a very reasonable number not only for the developer but also for your website visitors that they do not have to go through 100â€™s of pages.

Of course, on some custom sites this is just required and this will also reflect on the total price asked for such a website.
