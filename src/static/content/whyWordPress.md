WordPress is currently one of the most used Content Management System (CMS) on the world with almost 60% usage across all different Content Management Systems. WordPress is not only very flexible to develop on, but is also very user friendly for the end user to easily modify content and learn to work with the backend.

WordPress is made to be very easy to the end user so that pretty much anyone could learn how to create their own website with it. However, given the time it requires for someone to learn the various task required can sometimes be more taxing on the end user than when you let it be developed by an experienced web developer.

While we have WordPress the Content Management System as itself, we also have the general blogging & webpage system based around it being WordPress.com. Both however are quite different this especially in terms of modification and various things you are able to modify on it. WordPress.com is therefore very limited compared to the complete CMS that is WordPress itself.

With this we want to be clear that anyone with enough time on their hands could create their own website, however given the amount of hours you have to put into it to get everything up and running might end up costing you more than actually letting it be developed for you.

So if you are pretty new to the whole web developing business, then we do highly recommend you contact your closest web developer and ask for assistance. Most of the time they will accept collaborations with anyone who is willing to make their own site as with WordPress and their open community we completely promote the usage of WordPress, but we do want to make sure everything is setup properly!

So do not be afraid to contact anyone regarding your needs for your website and see for yourself what is possible for you to make your first step into the web world!
