This calculator offers a base of 12 of the most requested features of any website, and while you definitely do not need all, every one might be good to consider to build you a perfect website, that is not only good looking and properly written but also secure, fast and highly ranked!

#### Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) <a id="info-seo"></a>

One of the most requested features as SEO will help you improve your site’s ranking in Google and other Search Engines. We optimise your “WordPress” website with the right plugins and do keyword research per page to properly get your SEO ranking in order. Together with combining this with Google Search Console to always stay connected to your crawl results.

#### Social Media Optimisation (SMO) <a id="info-smo"></a>

A second important feature is SMO, this is mostly if you want to expand your website beyond the site as itself, here we will create accounts on popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, etc… to link back to your website so you have a steady trackback of your website and your social media activity.

#### Security Setup <a id="info-security"></a>

We take security very seriously and with this we mean that just installing an SSL certificate is not enough for a properly secured website. We keep the A+ standards from securityheaders.io to not only protect your own website for protentional harm but also your visitors as we take both the owner and the visitors in account when it comes to security!

#### Caching & Compression Setup <a id="info-caching"></a>

Caching & Compression is a very important part to make your website fast, and this doesn’t only influence your visitor’s behaviour on your website but also increases page ranking as Google takes page speed into account as well to provide the visitors the best experience.

#### Content Delivery Network (CDN) Setup <a id="info-cdn"></a>

A CDN is not for needed for every website, but if you have an international site it sure might help you provide your website to your visitors better. We recommend Cloudflare not only a Content Delivery Network but also provides DDOS protection and has proper measures in place to keep your site safe.

#### Server/Webhost Setup <a id="info-server"></a>

When starting a new project, you need a proper server or webhost for your website. Depending on the target audience location and the scale of your website, we can recommend the best option for your needs. Together that we can provide a setup service that will provide the correct server configuration to make your “WordPress” website work like it should.

#### Mail Setup <a id="info-mail"></a>

For proper mailing you need a proper configuration to make your custom domain mail not appear in the spam box of your visitor, that’s why we need to properly configure and secure it with SPF, DKIM and DMARK to make your mail properly compliant with most spam filters like SpamAssassin.

#### Image/Sliders Gallery <a id="info-gallery"></a>

If you want to have a visual appealing website an image or slider gallery is a perfect choice, with these you can present your photographs in a beautiful way and also very easily to use for your visitors.

#### PageBuilder Intergration <a id="info-pagebuilder"></a>

These days a lot of editing is being done with popular PageBuilders for site and in particular WordPress. However, some theme’s do not support PageBuilder and with this we want to properly configure the PageBuilder to work with your theme.

#### Contact Form <a id="info-contactform"></a>

Most if not all sites would like a contact form, sometimes this is an easy three field layout to just send a contact mail directly from your site, however this is not always the case as you can also properly customise your form to be dynamic and conditional if you require it for something more than a contact form.

#### Multilingual Intergration <a id="info-multilingual"></a>

Some sites require Multilingual support, and this can be done with via a range of options but is not always as easy just installing a plugin. Proper configuration is therefore required together with support of the theme to properly translate all the strings for it. With this feature we want to make the theme as well as the content fully multilingual in whatever language you desire.

#### Offsite Backup Intergration <a id="info-backup"></a>

It is always important to backup your website, in cases that you did something wrong, or updated a plugin or a core file that made the site go down. With this you can easily revert those changes and we will make it possible for you to store these backups locally on the server itself or on a cloudstorage like Google Drive, DropBox, One Drive and many more! The desired amount of backups can be configured on basis of how active your site is. It can backup from every four hours to a one time a month, and you can even say how many backups have to be preserved so it will automatically remove old and unneeded backups to make room for new ones.
