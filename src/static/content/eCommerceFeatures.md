Besides the above 12 basic features there are of course various E-Commerce features some websites or business might need.

#### Payment Gateway
The payment gateway is probably one of the most requested features as this provides a secure and easy way for your webshop clients to pay on your website. Besides PayPal we want to provide a whole range of checkout options and this specific for each country. That is why a Payment Gateway is also the best next thing to integrate into your E-Commerce website. With using a Payment Gateway there will be external cost added with every transaction but this is fairly reasonable, but certainly a thing to keep in mind when using one.

We opt into using Mollie for Europe and Stripe for America, but other Payment Gateways are definitely possible.

#### Social Login
With a social login you let your customers have the ease of registering on your E-Commerce webshop with one click of a button. If it's Facebook, Twitter or even Google Plus we got that covered. With having a Social Login added to your store it avoids the hassle to manually register an account onto your site and fill in personal data. Which makes it only easier and give your clients a better user experience.

#### Live Search
With the Live Search integration, we provide an easy and most important direct search functionality on your webshop. With the powers of a fast database and query searching you can provide a various range of products directly on the client's screen when they type in a keyword. This will give your clients a broader view of what they are looking for and might even expand the sales of various other products.

#### Live Chat
For some webshops it is handy to provide a Live Chat to directly communicate with your customers or have a bot do the talking for you, until you are available to take over. These kinds of Live Chat integration are very handy for quite large sites with lots of products or with products people might need more information for.

#### Catalog Mode
Not all E-Commerce websites have to be to directly sell products, but perhaps also to showcase your in-house products that are up for quote. With this feature you can have an E-Commerce site like experience without the any prices or transactions taken place on the website itself.

#### Point Of Sale (POS)
Some websites like to integrate their webshop's inventory to their Point Of Sale (POS) System, or better yet combine their E-Commerce webshop with a POS System. Having a direct link to an online inventory database when you also sell products in a store might really help you with stock management and will avoid you the hassle of dealing with out-of-stock products.
