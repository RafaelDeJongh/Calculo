Here we have three categories for the site types:

#### Standard

A standard website is what most people would need, this can range from a portfolio website to a small business one pager or landing page. These kinds of websites can easily range from €800 to €2000 excl. VAT.

The price can vary depending on the various features you select, but as a starting point it is what most clients will need.

#### E-Commerce

E-Commerce websites are a whole other story. A lot more thought needs to be added to creating an E-Commerce website, some features like Search Engine Optimisation (SEO), Social Media Optimisation (SMO) and Security are almost a definite must have, and can easily range from €3000 to €6000 excl. VAT.

#### Custom Production

Custom Production websites are the priciest and most advanced kind of website type. This allows the client to request a more specific website equipped with custom functionality that has to be created specifically for them.

This is also the least picked option as the price for these kinds of websites tends to be €8000 or even more than €10000 excl. VAT, as it requires a lot more hours to be put into the development.
