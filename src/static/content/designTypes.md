With design types we could have a lot more options but we simplified it to two, making it more understandable for everyone. Here we have:

#### Template

Choosing a template allows faster developments and is more affordable. By choosing an existing template, your developer will focus on adjusting it to your needs, making the process easier for both parties.

WordPress has currently over 2000 Free quality themes. It really is one of the better choices to vastly lower the development cost of the actual website.

#### Premium Template

A premium template is a purchased template which cannot be found on the WordPress theme library, but on third party services that sell them. As this price can range from a 50 to 100 Euro and above, it really depends on what the requirements of that theme exactly are.

This is a great choice if you want something more specific to your needs and you found a lovely theme on ThemeForest or other third-party theme sellers.

#### Modified Template

A modified template in regards to a normal or premium template, takes these both template parts and allows you to ask your developer to make further adjustments to it. This allows you to even further make the template and the site unique to yourself. This is excellent choice if you want something more unique but do not want a complete custom design.

#### Custom Design

A Custom Design on the other hand is made completely from scratch. Both a design team and UI/UX expert will work on the theme to create that perfect and unique fit for you. This will increase the development cost quite a bit, but it set your website apart and allow it to better match your brand.
